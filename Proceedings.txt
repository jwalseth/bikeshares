Bike Share working group of OSM. Proceedings of 7/25/2016 at SOTM US

About 10 people came to the workshop at SOTM US titled:

"Let's add bike-share stations to OSM" led by Jim Walseth

Included in his introduction was an invitation to navigate to his shared folder on Dropbox,
using this URL http://tinyurl.com/sotm16bikeshares and open the file 
"Bike Shares working group for OSM 'boot strap' info.txt"

Unfortunately Jim had failed to upload the file to the folder, sorry! It is there now.

The contents are reproduced here for convenience:

After introductions, Jim and the attendees proceeded to 'self organize' using the lean coffee
technique. Each person wrote down on a sticky pad a few ideas for how to tackle the problem.

The ideas were organized and will be summarized in a separate document on this github.

One concrete step was taken with the help fo Maxwell Burton. There was a demonstration of 
adding one bike share station using the "ID editor". A Pronto! [the Seattle bike share] station  
near Children's Hospital was added.

Thank you everyone who came and gamely participated in the self-organization exercise.

This concludes the proceedings for 7/25/2016 at SOTM US.
