About 10 people came to the workshop at SOTM US titled:

"Let's add bike-share stations to OSM" led by Jim Walseth

Jim lead the group in an agile method call 'lean coffee' in which
everyone wrote down ideas of how to proceed in the form of tasks
on sticky notes. What follows is a aggregation of those notes, in 
groupings that fell out.

These could be turned into github issues.
